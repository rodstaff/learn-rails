# Panacea
This is an app which is adapted from a book-tutorial in Ruby on Rails.  It includes some plugins:  SendGrid facilitates the email transactions smoothly while MailChimp gathers subscription email addresses for data collection purposes.  The app can also be extended to do some Analytics on visitor traffic.
